RAMP-QGIS
=========

This repository contains requirements and code for QGIS plugins to support MapAction's RAMP (Resilient Action for Mapping Preparedness) project.

[MapAction's](http://www.mapaction.org/) core purpose is to provide emergency mapping to support the process of humanitarian disaster response around the world. However it also supports local organisations, both governmental and non-governmental, in areas where humanitarian response is often needed, to develop their own capacity to produce mapping for the purpose of disaster management preparedness as well as response.

The RAMP project has been working towards this goal by developing internal expertise, training materials, processes, and data repositories, based around free and open source software, principally QGIS. In the course of the project, needs have been identified for functionality in QGIS to support simple file and data management, using folder structures and file-naming protocols. MapAction has developed an initial prototype which provides some of this functionality, and this repository holds that code, and requirements for further development by MapAction and others.
