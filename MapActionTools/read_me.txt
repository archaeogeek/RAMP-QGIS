2.  Start QGIS, select the menu:  Plugins | Manage plugins..
3.  From the list, find the tool 'MapAction Tools', Select it then click OK
4.  In the 'plugins' menu there is now an item MapAction Tools
5.  In the 'view | toolbars' there is now a toolbar MapAction Tools

*  Read / write access to the install folder is required for some of the toolbar functions.  Make sure you have this. 
** Before installation remove any previous installation of the 'DataNameTool' by deleting the folder in the plugins directory
   as this installation of MapAction Tools incorporates the functions of that tool.
